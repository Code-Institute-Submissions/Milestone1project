# MileStone 1 Project (Reptile Hotel)


Based (with information and permissions to use there brand) on a local reptile specialist pet shop [Reptile Hotel](http://www.thereptilehotel.co.uk/).

I'm creating the site to inform their customers of the services and products offered.

I'm also using the site to help the company create and maintain a sense of community using the CareSheets and gallery pages. 
 
## UX
 
User Stories.

User A ~ I am a potential  Gecko owner and I want to find out the temperature My Leapord Gecko needs to have So I know if I can supply the right care.

User B ~ I am a new customer with an existing pet looking for a new pet supply store so I can feed and care for my reptiles

User C ~ As a new pet owner I need to find a place to but pet supplies so I can travel there and purchase them.

User D ~ As the Owner of a pet with specialist dietary needs I need to know if a potential store can find and supply for these needs

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Home/Landing Page ~ on the home page I'm going to have a brief outline of the Store, including its history and a brief outling of their services.

Nav Bar ~ The Nav bar will be un-obtrusive when the user scrolls down the page.

The footer~ the footer will be repeated on each page and will include the contact details , social media accounts and a map to the stores location.
 

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

For this project I used the following technologies

- [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - this project uses HTML5 for is core structure.

- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    - this project uses CSS3 for its styling.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
